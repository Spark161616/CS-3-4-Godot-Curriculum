# Simple 2D Game - Learning Classes in Godot

## Project Overview  
This is a beginner-friendly project designed to teach object-oriented programming concepts in Godot, starting with the fundamentals of **classes**.

## Current State: Fresh Start
This project starts with just a player that can move around. Students will progressively add new classes and learn how objects interact.

## Learning Progression (Classes Unit)
1. **Lesson 1**: What is a class? Create your first Coin class
2. **Lesson 2**: Adding properties to classes (coin value, appearance)  
3. **Lesson 3**: Adding methods to classes (coin collection behavior)
4. **Lesson 4**: Class interaction (player collecting coins)
5. **Lesson 5**: Multiple instances (many coins from one class)
6. **Lesson 6**: Class variations (different coin types)

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move player
- **Space**: (will be used for actions in later lessons)

## For Students New to Godot
This project assumes no prior Godot experience. Each lesson introduces one new concept at a time and builds on previous lessons.

## For Teachers  
- Each lesson focuses on ONE core concept
- Students create code from scratch (minimal starter code)
- Lessons include guiding questions but not direct answers
- Teacher guides provide solutions and explanations
